Q. How to add JS ?

1. Inline JS (Specific inside the element tag)
2. Internal JS (Inside the body tag <script> ... </script>)
3. External JS (Best). (<script src=".." charset="utf-8"></script>)

Q. What is 'defer' ?

- When we insert JS link (external js) inside head. we use defer to load it first for no error further.
- The site loaded top to bottom. if we written a code in js that connected with the HTML. hence if the html not loaded then it may comes to an error.
- For resolving this we use 'defer' attribute.
